You resided with your stern but caring family, helping your mother with the chores and your father with the plowing, until the fateful day came when, in preparation for the Fall Moon Festival, you accidentally destroyed the Scared Tooth of Baelorn in the midst of moving it to the village plaza.&#xA;        &#xA;The three-foot dragon tooth had remained hidden within the safe confines of your church, a memorial of the time when an ancient red dragon descended upon Townsend many decades ago with intent to devour the little village. Baelorn, the god of strength and protection, flew from the heavens and drove his mighty axe through the dragon's neck, saving your village from a gruesome fate. He had given the elder of the village the largest tooth from the mighty dragon's jaw, promising that so long as the village kept that tooth safe, dragons would never dare attack the village again. His word was true, as Aranox, a fierce dragon that often sought to destroy the village, could do no more than fume impatiently within the depths of his lair, hidden within the nearby mountains. And so the Tooth was kept safe deep within the vaults of the church, except for when it was placed in the center of the village during the Fall Moon Festival, when the villagers celebrated the end of the harvest and gave thanks to their merciful god, Baelorn.

But so it has passed, and now the magic is gone, the seals are broken; it will not take the dragons long to figure out that your village is prey once more, and Aranox has been eagerly waiting for a chance to ravage it...&#xA;&#xA;Shunned by your village folk, you have been sent to face the fearsome dragon Aranox deep within the mountains. Should you defeat the terrible beast and retrieve his largest tooth, the god Baelorn will accept your triumph and enchant the tooth so that it will protect village once more. Should you fail, Aranox will be satisfied, if only for a while, granting the village time to relocate to another city. Either way, the village will be saved.
