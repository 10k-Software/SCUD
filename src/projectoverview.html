<h3>I. Identification</h3>

<h3>II. Design Overview</h3>

<p>ProjectSCUD is an event-driven application that incorporated three major
components: the user interface, game logic, and environment library
(data).&nbsp; In general, the UI handles input from the player and sends it to
the game logic.&nbsp; Then, the game logic uses the environment library to
execute the action, and calls the UI to display the result of their action back
to the player. The UI then waits again for user input, and this process
continues until the user chooses to quit.</p>

<p>More specifically, the control of the program begins in the ScudApp, where
it checks the command-line parameters for flags or if a filename is
provided.&nbsp; It then creates an instance of the GameLogic and the desired
ScudUI. If a –c flag was provided via command-line, then the ScudUI will be a
ConsoleUI; else, it will be a SwingUI by default.&nbsp; The GameLogic begins by
parsing the level file and populating the EnvironmentLibrary.&nbsp; It will then
wait for input from the user via the initialized ScudUI. When the user
interface receives a command, it is passed along to the GameLogic, which
executes the action, updates the EnvironmentLibrary and sets the text for the
ScudUI to display. Control then returns to the ScudUI,</p>

<p>The EnvironmentLibrary handles all of the data required to run the game.&nbsp;
It contains all of the Rooms, Actions, and Items that the level will have as
well as keeps track of the Player and the current Room.&nbsp; Rooms contain a
list of available Actions and Items.&nbsp; Actions have lists of Items required
(if any) to perform the Action and the resulting action to take if current
action is a success or failure. Items in the room can be obtained and added to
the user’s inventory.</p>

<p>The LevelParser is responsible for the actual parsing of the level.&nbsp; A
level is represented as an xml file containing descriptions of all the rooms,
items, and actions.&nbsp; The LevelParser will take these descriptions and
create their associated Room, Item, and Action objects, placing them in the
EnvironmentLibrary.&nbsp; </p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The
ScudUI interface describes the methods a UI needs to have.&nbsp; There are two
current implementations of this interface: SwingUI, a GUI based component and
ConsoleUI, a console version.&nbsp; Once the GameLogic has parsed the level
into the EnvironmentLibrary, ScudUI initializes and waits for input.<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></h3>

<h3>III.<span class=GramE>&nbsp; Design</span> Issues</h3>

<p><b>Issue #1:&nbsp;</b> Should the Console UI be separate from the application
code?</p>

<p><b>Alternative A:</b> Implement it as part of the application code.</p>

<p>Advantages: The design is simpler and faster to implement. Because there is
no separation of the user interfaces, it removes some duplicate code.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: However, the design is less flexible and actually creates
more duplicate code than it removes. GUI code cannot be similarly implemented
and is set as one big edge case.</p>

<p><b>Alternative B:&nbsp;</b> Choose a separate application class and UI
class, and create a UI interface.</p>

<p>Advantages: The entry point is not a part of the console class, which makes
for a more clear design. The user interfaces are specifically separated from
all other code. Meanwhile, the UI Interface makes both console and GUI classes
act the same in the eyes of the game logic. This effectively removes any
special-case handling for either UI.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: The design is more complex as more classes exist.</p>

<p><b>Decision:</b>&nbsp; Alternative B. The advantages easily outweigh the
costs of moving over to a new design. The overall design becomes easier to
understand and implement.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Issue #2:&nbsp;</b> Should the UI classes use the same function to handle
output from the GameLogic class?</p>

<p><b>Alternative A:</b> The UI classes use the exact same function to handle
GameLogic output. </p>

<p>Advantages: This decreases the amount of code required to be written, while
decreasing the amount of work that the GameLogic is required to do. The GameLogic
only has to return strings to the UI, which will handle all state information
and WAIT flags in the action descriptions.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: The function required to be written, though only written
once, requires a lot of overhead, as the GUI’s method to update its text boxes
is far different than the console UI’s method to update the console.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, plenty of logical code will be in the
UI classes.</p>

<p><b>Alternative B:&nbsp;</b> Keep all logic within the GameLogic class, and
send the output to an interface function implemented by both UIs. </p>

<p>Advantages: Allows the project to better reflect an MVC style framework. Each
UI can easily handle the text via <span class=GramE>their own</span>
implemented function, which the GameLogic can call despite which UI is running.
</p>

<p>Disadvantages: Creates more UI control methods.</p>

<p><b>Decision:</b>&nbsp; Alternative B. The code for alternative A was a
complete mess when it was first attempted. The console UI, which could originally
update the console with only one line of code, now required several lines, as
well as BufferedReader and BufferedWriter objects. Alternative B leaves much
cleaner code in its wake.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Issue #3:&nbsp;</b> Should the default level file be included in the jar
file?</p>

<p><b>Alternative A:</b> Include it in the jar file.</p>

<p>Advantages: This results in an all-in-one jar file, which means less
downloads for the user.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: It is hard to implement file handling within jar files, as it
requires a resource handler class (for one implementation).</p>

<p><b>Alternative B:&nbsp;</b> Keep any level files separate.</p>

<p>Advantages: This allows users to always choose what level to use, or to easily
replace the default level. </p>

<p>Disadvantages: It lacks the ease-of-use of one file and does not work
out-of-box unless the user downloads a level file as well.</p>

<p><b>Decision:</b>&nbsp; Alternative A, for the time being. Learning how to
handle files within the jar file is possible, but the time requirements made
the option less attractive. Time was better spent on other aspects of the
design.</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><b>Issue #4:&nbsp;</b> Should the UI interface include <span class=GramE>setInventory(</span>)
and setActionList() methods?</p>

<p><b>Alternative A:</b> Include the methods in the UI interface.</p>

<p>Advantages: Both UI classes would be more similar in terms of what methods
they allowed, resulting in simpler design. Any GUI could be updated by the
GameLogic class at any time.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: It would force all UI classes to implement methods that may
not be useful in all situations. More design changes may apply in order for the
UI classes to use the methods effectively. The GameLogic class would have to
change how it gives the action and item lists to the UI classes.</p>

<p><b>Alternative B:&nbsp;</b> Avoid implementing <span class=GramE>setInventory(</span>)
and setActionList() methods.</p>

<p>Advantages: By keeping the UI interface simpler, it avoids useless code in
some UI implementations, especially for the console UI. It also keeps the data
out of the UI classes' hands until it needs it. Because the user only receives
control after the game logic is finished with its processing, any GUI updating
could be handled before the user is queried for another command.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: The GameLogic class would still have to hold the item and
action lists. UI classes needing the lists would have to call a function in the
GameLogic class.</p>

<p><b>Decision:</b>&nbsp; Alternative B was chosen because the cost outweighed
the benefits. The console class simply never used the lists unless it wanted to
run a help or inventory command, and even then, it would only need the
toString() of each item or action, and not the actual object itself. </p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><b>Issue #5:&nbsp;</b> Should the GUI include a dropdown menu of all actions
or a text box, allowing the user to type in the actions?</p>

<p><b>Alternative A:</b> Include a GUI dropdown menu of available actions.</p>

<p>Advantages: The GUI would have an easy-to-use dropdown list of actions. The
users would not have to look up actions in order to use them.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: The GUI would have to update its list of actions every time
an action is called, which could be costly depending on the implementation. Large
lists of actions would be cumbersome to navigate through. It also detracts from
the puzzle-game concept of being able to search a room unrestricted, allowing
the user to use his imagination, rather than being told what he can or can’t
do.</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><b>Alternative B:&nbsp;</b> Include a text box and allow the user to type in
actions.</p>

<p>Advantages: The GUI would not have to update itself as much. A textbox would
be more versatile, allowing the user to use more complex commands (like use
&lt;ITEM&gt; on &lt;OBJECT&gt;) if they are to be implemented in the future.</p>

<p>Disadvantages: This implementation would force the users to type in the
actions rather than simply select them from a list, making the implementation slightly
harder to use.</p>

<p><b>Decision:</b>&nbsp; Alternative B was chosen because a text box would
allow for future improvements without many design changes.</p>
